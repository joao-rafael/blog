Since I graduated, earlier this year, lots of things in my life changed. I got a scholarship for a Masterâ€™s Degree, launched this blog alongside other projects and, most recently, got a scholarship from [Santander Universidades](https://www.santander.com.br/universidades) to study mobile development.

Currently, I am finishing my first semester as a masters students (which was a full-time semester due to the amount of credits that I opted to get) with the expectation to land a Job in the software development market next months.

## Studying and Choosing a Path

Having a Front-End development background and some experience in mobile development, I am currently studying about native Android Development and about React.js/React Native - Which one I will choose to follow later on? Only time will tell me, for now I'm enjoying to learn about both. 

## Building A Portfolio

With my objective in mind, and also for fun purposes, I'm currently building up a projects' portfolio to showcase my abilities. In addition to that, I'm trying to use my free time to study, build my projects, and, for my health sake, rest and have fun. 

I'm still using 
[GitHub](https://github.com/joao-rafael/blog) to showcase my projects, as I dive in different mobile development tools, I expect to have some apps published at an app market soon.

## Not Giving Up

For me it's important to keep in my mind that getting the first full-time job in some field that you never got other full-time experience (if you don't consider researching and studying a job). 

Obviously you have to have the discipline needed and confirm your knowledge by some way to the potential employer but keep in mind to keep studying and investing in yourself until you make it (and, after). Everyone has passed by this point sometime in their lives.

## Why I wrote this text

This text was more like a story record from myself - a report. Maybe it can be Helpful to other beginner developers, and, even if it doesn't, I think it can be a good story about starting points in life. 

For now, I'm wrapping this text up, hope I'll give an update about my journey soon - Thanks for reading until this point, don't hesitate to contact me if you want. See you! #KeepOnGoing.
