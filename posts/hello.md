Hello there! Welcome to Coding Bits, a blog dedicated to talk about technology, programming and life itself.
This is the start of something new, I expect to write here often and I hope that the articles that I will write helps
people.
In the technical side, this blog is built in React.js + Next.js, it uses static page generation in order to post new
articles without the need for a backend application programming interface.

```javascript
console.log('hello world');
console.log('this is my first post.');
```
