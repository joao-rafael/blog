Hello there! Welcome to Coding Bits, a blog dedicated to talking about technology, programming and life itself.
This blog is the start of something new, I expect to write here often and hope that the posted articles will help people.
On the technical side, this is a static website made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It uses static page generation to post new articles without the need for a backend application programming interface.

```javascript
console.log('hello world');
console.log('this is my first post.');
```
> Just playing around with the post template.

## About me

I'm a full-time Informatics Masters Student with a CS and web development background. Currently, I'm a Scholarship Recipient at [UFPB](https://www.ufpb.br/). I'm studying Algorithms, multimedia systems, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interface and Software Development while also researching HCI and engineering guidelines to develop better software solutions aimed at people in the autism spectrum (which is the theme of my thesis).
